  description: 'Add a new tool to the registry. Creates YAML entry, module stub, and
    test stub.


    IMPORTANT: Tool descriptions shape how agents understand and use tools.

    Write descriptions as if they''re the only documentation an agent will read.


    After calling this:

    1. Implement the function in the created stub

    2. Run tests: uv run pytest tests/test_<namespace>/test_<tool>.py

    3. Restart MCP server to use the new tool
