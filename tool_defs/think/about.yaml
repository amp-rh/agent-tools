name: think.about
description: 'Pause and think deeply about a problem before acting.


  Use this when facing a complex or unclear situation. Returns structured thinking
  prompts to help analyze:

  - What is the actual problem?

  - What do I know vs assume?

  - What are the options?

  - What could go wrong?


  This is the foundation for deliberate problem-solving. More specialized thinking
  tools branch from here.'
