name: code.complexity
description: 'Analyze code complexity metrics for Python files.

  Use this to identify functions that are too complex, too long, deeply nested,
  or have too many parameters. Helps prioritize refactoring efforts.

  Metrics analyzed:
  - Cyclomatic complexity (branches, loops, conditionals)
  - Function length (lines of code)
  - Nesting depth
  - Parameter count

  Returns functions ranked by complexity with specific recommendations.'
