name: code.refactor
description: 'Comprehensive refactoring analysis chain.

  Use this when asked to refactor, clean up, or improve code quality.

  Chains multiple analyzers:
  - Duplication: Duplicate functions, same-name functions
  - Complexity: Cyclomatic complexity, function length, nesting depth
  - Architecture: Circular dependencies, layer violations

  Returns a prioritized refactoring plan with:
  - Priority 1: Critical issues (high complexity, circular deps)
  - Priority 2: Major issues (duplication, layer violations)
  - Priority 3: Minor issues (naming, moderate complexity)
  - Recommended actions ordered by impact'
