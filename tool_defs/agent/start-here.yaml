name: agent.start-here
description: 'ALWAYS call this first before attempting any task.


  Returns available tools and the workflow for using agent-tools.


  If a tool exists for your task, use it.

  If no tool exists and the task is repeatable, create one with registry-add first,
  then use it.


  Every repeatable process becomes a tool. Your job is to think. Tools do the work.'
