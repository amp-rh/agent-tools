  Analyzes your task, checks for existing tools, and recommends whether to:

  1. Use an existing tool

  2. Create a new tool first (if repeatable)

  3. Do it manually (rare, one-off tasks)


  This replaces jumping straight to execution. Describe what you''re about to do,
  and this tool will help you approach it correctly.'
